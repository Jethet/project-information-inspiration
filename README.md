# Information for Inspiration
## *work in progress*

## Description

Many people save notes, articles, pictures and more, to use sometime in the future, maybe for an article or for their studies. There are many reasons to save information, but what if you want to see it because you need inspiration to write that article, or to look at something specific for your research? 

The Information Inspiration app enables users to keep the information they want to save in one place. It is a very practical solution: store your notes, pictures, links etc. on cards with a title, a description, and a date. The info cards are saved in the local storage of the browser that is used (note: the info cards are not available when changing your browser: local storage is specific to a browser and is not a database).

The user can:
-  create information cards with title, description, and date
-  search, view, edit and delete information cards
-  through the search function, have an overview of all the information cards that contain the same search term

## Backlog
-  automatically keep last search on start page
-  enable uploading of images
-  enable attaching of files
